# Learn Coding
First let's learn python, ideal for complete beginners!

```py
print("Hello World")
```

# Output
```
Hello World
```
Now that we have learned that the print command outputs whatever you type in quotes. Let's learn how to use variables in python.

To make a variable in python you need a equals sign (=) after the variable like this:
```py
example1 = "Content here"
```
The variable can also store a integer like this:
```py
example2 = 1
```
Lastly the variable can store a boolean like `True` or `False` like this:
```py
example3 = True
example4 = False
```
Rules of naming a variable:
1. Don't use numbers as the first character in your variable.
2. Don't use special characters to be in the name. Not including underscores.
3. Don't use reserved keyword in python like the print command you learned earlier.

If you made it this far you might be wondering, how do i even get or install python? To install python follow these steps:
1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
2. Click on the yellow download button.
3. Once your file downloads launch it like any other program you download. If you are using a Mac you must drag it into the applications folder.


Now that we have made it this far its time to go shopping!

When I mean by shopping I mean by making a shopping list in python. To make a list you need to know the concept of making **variables** first. but instead put square brackets [ ]

Like this:
```py
shopping_list = ["apples", "oranges"]
```
Like variables they can include integers or numbers like this:
```py
shopping_list_amount = [0, 1, 2]
```
You can also put lists inside the `print` method to print the list out, this happens the same with variables.

Lastly before we end it here I want to discuss comments are simply use to tell other coders that "Hey! this thing does this, this thing does that!" There is also multi-line comements which can be put on several lines. like this:
```py
# This is a normal comment
"""
This
is 
a
multi
line
comment
"""
# But if I put the the hashtag intead of the 3 quotes

# This
is
a
multi
line
comment
# It would spill!!
```

Yay! you mastered the fundamentals of python! Now let's move on to javascript.
---
Javascript is a language used on most websites. Without javascript your favorite websites will never run properly!

Use the `console.log` method to simply output something like this:
```js
console.log("Hello World")
```
Javascript simply works like python you can also put lists inside the `console.log` method to output lists or variables

Now that we talked about the similarity now let's talk about the differences.
 To make a variable you need to specify neither its a constant or a normal variable. Constants behave directly the same as the meaning of the word. You cannot change the variable. To make a constant you use the `const` menthod like this:
   ```js
   const my_constant = "Content here"
   ```
   To make a normal variable you use the `let` method if you use `let` you will be able to change the value like this:
   ```js
   let my_normal_variable = "Content here"
   my_normal_variable = "Content there"
   ```
One more similarity is that you have comments but you use the `//` for comments and `/*` then `/*` for multi-line comments like this:
```js
    // this is a comment
    /* this
       is
       a
       comment
    /*
```
